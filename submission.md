## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - my_results)/my_results)`.

## Reflections

I really enjoyed working on this project for the last few weeks.  Can't say the same about the first 8 weeks.  My initial approach was muddled and unorganized and I finally decided to scrap it and do it slightly more correct.  I realized the first time around that my main mistake was not understanding the data before beginning.  I just dove in attempting to follow the code without really understanding the different columns.  This caused many mistakes to go unnoticed as it was just a pile of numbers to me.  Before starting attempt #2 I read the assignment prompt and looked at the data as well as the files to have a better understanding of the overall goal.  Personally, I think it unintentionally was a great end of semester project. I had the python understanding to plan the full process more and create somewhat organized code as well as being much more familiar with GBQ.  I really learned from this project how useful it is have as many tools avaialable to you as possibe.  The first time around I struggled to find answers for 1 way to perform a task. This often caused me to have reduntant lists and excessive transformations between data types. The second time, I often knew multiple ways the job could be done and could choose the simplest or most efficient way from point A to point B.
